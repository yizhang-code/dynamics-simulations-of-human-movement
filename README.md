# dynamics-simulations-of-human-movement
project aims to understand fundamental dynamics of human's movement, and proposes a model to capture several important features of human movement.

The mechanisms of human's movement are very complicated, there is no a general rule of thrumb which explains what's happening in real work. 
However, based on the real-observed data in preschool classroom, we do find some general patterns that can be helpful to understand the mechanism and build explainable model.

1. distances between children in classroom are not randomly distributed. Data shows that children tend to interact to others at a "confortable" distance,
   and radial distribution function g(r) indicates a peak aroud this perticular distace.
  
2. relative orientations of children and their patners are not randomly distributed. Data also shows that children tend to be oriented in a "shoulder-to-shoulder" way when distance between is short. Whereas children are more likely to be oriented in a "face-to-face" way at a relatively larger distance.


Based on the above observed patterns, we build a model that assumes children behave as ferromagnets at a short distance, while antiferromagne at a relatively larger distance. The results shows this model well captures several feathers of human movement.
